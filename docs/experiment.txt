🎨 Creative Goal
Create a moving kaleidoscopic fractal video where patterns:
Mirror symmetrically like a kaleidoscope


Recursively fold inward (zooming into themselves forever)


Generate complex geometric forms (like stained glass or mandalas)


Feel alive, organic, hypnotic, and cinematic


Think:
 infinite zoom + symmetry + fractal math + rich color gradients

🧠 Core Visual Principles
1. Kaleidoscope Symmetry
Use radial mirroring.
6-way, 8-way, or 12-way symmetry


Center anchor point


Mirror segments like a real kaleidoscope tube


Result → repeating petals / mandala shapes.

2. Recursive Zoom
The pattern should zoom into itself continuously.
Methods:
Infinite zoom loop


Scale inward while generating new detail


Use feedback loops


Result → viewer feels like falling into the pattern.

3. Fractal Generation
Use fractal algorithms for complexity.
Good options:
Mandelbrot zooms


Julia sets


L-systems


Noise-based fractals


Reaction-diffusion patterns


These generate organic geometric detail automatically.

4. Motion Design
Movement should feel smooth and hypnotic.
Use:
Slow rotation


Pulsing scale


Color cycling


Warping distortions


Camera drift in 3D space


Avoid random chaos. Motion should feel intentional.

Workflow option a:
Create fractal texture layer


Add radial mirror effect


Animate scale + rotation


Add feedback loop for recursion


Color-grade with gradients


Best for motion designers.

Workflow option b:
Generate fractal math texture in shader


Apply polar coordinate transform


Mirror angle segments


Animate time variable


Apply infinite zoom via UV scaling


This gives buttery smooth infinite visuals.



🎯 Style Direction
Color
Jewel tones


Neon stained glass


High contrast


Smooth gradient transitions


Texture
Sharp crystalline edges


Slight noise for organic feel


Glow highlights


Motion Speed
Slow meditative base


Occasional faster bursts



📐 Specific Instructions You Can Copy-Paste
Here’s a short brief you can send them:

Design Brief
Create a looping video that combines:
• 8-way kaleidoscope symmetry
 • Infinite recursive zoom toward center
 • Fractal-generated geometry
 • Smooth hypnotic motion
The pattern should continuously fold inward while new detail appears, like falling into an infinite mandala.
Use jewel-tone colors, high contrast, glowing edges, and slow cinematic motion.
Output:
 • 4K loopable video
 • 30–60 seconds seamless loop
 • Optional depth/3D camera drift

💡 Advanced Ideas
Add audio reactivity


Make it interactive (mouse controls zoom)


Layer multiple fractals


Use depth map for parallax


Add subtle particle dust

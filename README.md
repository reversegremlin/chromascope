# Chromascope: Audio-Reactive Particle Universe
## High-Energy Physics & Sacred Geometry Renderers

Chromascope is a project dedicated to translating sound into organic, high-intensity particle simulations. It combines fluid dynamics, fractal geometry, and radioactive decay physics into a single, audio-reactive visual suite.

### 🎨 Featured Experiment: `chromascope-decay`
The **Radioactive Cloud Chamber** renderer is a Wilson-style simulation that captures the beauty of atomic decay.

*   **Dual-Buffer Vapor Engine:** High-intensity Ionization Tracks (Alpha/Beta/Gamma) and persistent, drifting Smoke Buffers.
*   **Dynamic Symmetrical Mirroring:** Two independent radioactive worlds ("Matter" and "Antimatter") slide symmetrically along a locked axis.
*   **Intersection Collision:** The simulations are centered such that they ALWAYS clash in the middle of the screen.
*   **Annihilation Coloring:** Collision zones trigger an intense, high-contrast Magenta / Cyan / White-Hot color reaction.
*   **Cinematic Slow-Sweep:** Smooth, sub-pixel interpolated motion that follows the musical energy.

#### **Run the Experiment:**
```bash
chromascope-decay path/to/audio.wav --mirror cycle --interference resonance --style neon
```

### 🚀 Key Features
*   **Audio-Reactive Physics:** Every particle kick, drag force, and color shift is mapped to musical features (Sub-bass, Percussive Impact, Spectral Flux).
*   **Mirror Compositing:** Multi-instance simulations (Instance A & B) with independent local RNG states.
*   **Interference Engine:** Resonance (12.0x boost), Constructive, and Destructive overlap math.
*   **Sub-Pixel Smoothness:** Motion is rendered using Bilinear Interpolation for 100% jitter-free results at any resolution.

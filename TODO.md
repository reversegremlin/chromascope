1. ~~glass style - glass slices i think is just adding slices below, we want to make it add more dimensionality to the slices like more facets in the mirror or something. make glass more kalideskope like Kaleidoscopes.jpg in the directory~~ DONE - Rewrote Glass style with triangular tessellation, hexagonal gem facets with internal cut patterns, prismatic light rays, diamond sparkles, and gradient crystal shards
2. ~~Fibonacci isn't very fibonacci, think more golden spiral meets kalideskope, how might we express the beauty of the golden ratio with the fractured geometry of kaliideskope~~ DONE - Rewrote Fibonacci with phyllotaxis sunflower pattern (golden angle), reflected golden spirals, Fibonacci-numbered petal rings (3,5,8,13), nested golden rectangles with spiral arcs, and sacred geometry core
3. ~~The backgrounds are a bit bland, I really want the whole background to be expanded to a full screen, fractal expanding off the screen in kalideskope patterns.~~ DONE - Added full-screen fractal kaleidoscope background with expanding radial lines, polygon rings, mirrored triangles at multiple depths, and connecting arcs
